        <h2>Discrete Math - LaTeX</h2>
        <p>
            I graduated from Cornell University in 2021 with a degree in Mathematics (Theoretical Concentration) and
            German Studies. I was absolutely certain that I never wanted to go to grad school - after 1.5 years of covid
            classes, I was sick of it! I started my job in consulting and ended up in the Robotics Process Automation
            division working as a low code developer. It has been a crazy journey, working with a variety of clients, in
            a variety of time zones, but it has taught me that I actually do enjoy computer science and programming more
            than I thought. I love building things from scratch. There's something so satisfying about creating a
            program and seeing it run successfully. It doesn't hurt that I think I'm pretty good at it!</p>

        <p>I'd like to do more than just low code development, though. So I've been considering getting a masters in
            Computer Science. This would give me a solid background in the fundamentals of development and help me take
            my skills to the next level. At Cornell, I took a few CS classes, but before I make the jump into grad
            school I should have a better understanding of undergraduate computer science. My lovely life partner Sam
            Sorenson and my close friend Michael Xing studied Math and CS at Cornell, and they have given me a list of
            classes/books. I'm hoping these materials will help me decide whether I should get a masters and if I do
            want to, help me prepare. Sam recommended that I start with CS2800 at Cornell, the Discrete Math course. It
            starts out with a lot of review material - number theory, writing proofs, and sets - which should ease me
            into the exciting and unfamiliar topics of Automata and Metalogic. </p>

        <p>TLDR: I'm 'auditing' (reviewing?) the <a

                material</a>, to gain a deeper understanding of
            Discrete Math.</p>

        <h2>Update as of 2023: This coursework (and many other factors!) inspired me to get my Masters of Science in
            Information at the University of Michigan. I'll be graduating in 2025! Continue to follow along for more
            updates on my learnings. </h2>
