    <p>Welcome to <em>Häkeln Himmel</em>! My name is Skye (or
    <dfn>Himmel</dfn> in German) and I've been crocheting (<dfn>häkeln</dfn>)
    for about 15
    years. My mom taught me to crochet when I was 7 years old and I went
    from making fuzzy Hannah Montana-esque scarves to sweaters and
    <dfn>amigurumi</dfn>,
    or crocheted stuffed animals. During college, crocheting has functioned
    as my stress-reliever. I went from crocheting every once in a while, to
    every night! The more I crocheted, the more I improved and evolved. I'd
    like to share my progress and the patterns I've designed with my fellow
   avid crocheters and anyone interested in the art of <em>häkeln</em>!</p>
    <p>On this website you will find a catalogue of my past crochet
      projects, updates on my current crochet projects, and links to
      the patterns.</p>
