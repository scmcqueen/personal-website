# ARCHIVED Personal website

I started this website in 2021 as part of a school project, for my intro web design class at Cornell. It was an incredibly edifying experience and my first time ever really doing front-end (aside from customizing my old tumblr blog). I spent many years using this website and wishing that there was an easier way to do things (I really was copying and pasting the header over & over & over again). Then I took a course during my master's degree that introduced me to templating with django! I don't need a sql database so I opted to use Hugo instead, to set up a website and a blog.

This was a great learning experience! Sad to see this site go away, but also glad to have an easier & more useful personal website.
