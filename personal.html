         <!--<p>I am passionate about volunteering and education! While at Cornell,
           I volunteered at the Math Explorer's Club to teach middle and high
           school students about advanced topics in math and at the Julia
           Robinson Math Festival to stimulate young womens' interest in STEM.
           I also was on the executive board of the
           <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~awm/index.html">Association for
            Women in Mathematics Cornell Chapter</a>, where I hosted article
            discussions and social events on a biweekly basis. I also did all of the
            graphic design for AWM while I was on the eboard.</p> -->
            <p>What is there to say? I am a recent graduate from Cornell University,
            where I studied Mathematics & German Studies. I work as a Robotics
            Process Automation Consultant in the Bay Area. I love my wfh lifestyle-
            I recently got a desk treadmill, so now I am unstoppable! In my free
            time, I like to hike, crochet, game, and look for any opportunity to
            practice my German.</p>
