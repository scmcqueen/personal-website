## Submission

**Place an x between the [] after you have completed each step.** (example: [x])

- [] I have checked that each resource included in my submission adheres to the course citation policy.

    Failure to adhere to the citation policy will result in a deduction for the assignment.

- [] All of the code I am submitting is my own work.

    If you used other code as reference when writing your own code, please cite the resource via a comment.

- [] I will **verify** that my _entire_ submission has been **pushed** to Cornell's GitHub after I commit and push this file.

    Failure to push to GitHub is the same as not submitting an assignment. No submission = 0. See the assignment submission policy.

    Forgetting to _push_ is **never** considered a valid excuse. It is your responsibility to **verify** that you **pushed** your submission.

- [] I understand that **my assignment submission time, is the time of my last push**, not the time of my last commit.

    The date and times listed in GitHub are **commit** times. Not push times. GitHub does not show push times. As an instructor, we have access to your push times.

- [] I am ready to have my assignment graded.

    **Never check this box unless you actually want us to grade your submission.** If we see this box is checked, we will start grading your assignment.

**Sign your name and include today's date and time to submit your MILESTONE 1.**
