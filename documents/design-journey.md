# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


## Markdown Instructions

This is a Markdown file. All written documents that you will submit this semester will be Markdown files. Markdown is a commonly used format by developers and bloggers. It's something that you should know. Learning it is a learning outcome of this course.

The following links are Markdown references:
- <https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/>
- <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>

When writing your Markdown file in Atom. Open the command palette and search for **Markdown Preview Plus: Toggle**. This will open up a panel in Atom where you can preview your formatted Markdown file. **The graders will grade you submission in Markdown Preview. All images must be visible in Markdown Preview.**

This is how your insert images into your Markdown documents:

**DELETE THIS SECTION (and example.png) BEFORE THE FINAL SUBMISSION.**


## Audience & Content

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.


**No sketches are required for Milestone 1.**

### Website Topic (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain what your website will be about.

My website will be focused on my passion for crocheting! I'd like to display

* Previous Projects
* Works in progress
* Patterns I've designed
* Contact information


### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain who the intended audience(s) is for your website. Be specific and justify why this audience is appropriate for your site's topic.

The intended audiences for my website will be

* __Avid Crocheters:__ This audience would visit my website to find inspiration for new crochet projects.
* __Potential Customers:__ Potential customers would look at my website to see whether they would want to commission a project from me and find contact details in order to order something.


### Final Content (Milestone 1)
> Briefly describe the content you plan to include in the final site, and why it's the right content for your audiences.

Previously, I outlined what I wanted to display and now I'll expand upon that.

* __Previous Projects:__ This would show images, descriptions, materials, and links to patterns of previous crochet projects I've made.
  * Avid crocheters could use these projects as inspiration or to find patterns.
  * Potential customers would use these to see if they like my work and decide whether they would be interesting in commissioning a project.
* __Works in progress:__ This content would be updates on my current project: images and my thoughts on the project.
  * This content would be relevant for avid crocheters as they could relate to this content and may benefit from knowing how difficult or challenging I find it.
  * This content may not be as particularly relevant for potential customers.
* __Patterns I've designed:__ I would include links to pdfs of patterns that I have created.
  * Avid crocheters may be interested in using these patterns for their own projects.
  * Potential customers would find these patterns relevant as they could see designs that I am adept at and could make.
* __Contact information:__ This would be my email address.
  * This content wouldn't be relevant for avid crocheters.
  * This content would be relevant for potential customers, as they would need this to place a commission.



### Home Page Content (Milestone 1)
> Briefly identify what content you will include on the homepage and why this content should be the first thing your target audience sees when they visit your site.

On the homepage, I would like the content to be sparse, not overwhelming.
* __Title:__ This is important as the target audience should know the name of the website they are on.
* __Contact information:__ This should be easily accessible on the front page, so that the target audience can find it without difficulty.
* __Image of crochet project:__ An image of a crochet project should be the first thing my target audience sees, as this is the main theme of the website. It should be clear to the user what the website is about.
* __Introduction:__ An introduction to the purpose of the website is important, to make it clear to the audience what the website is about.
* __Navigation Panel:__ This would be one of the first things that the target audience sees, so that they have a clear way to access the other pages on the website.



## Information Architecture

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (2-4 sentences).

**No sketches are required for Milestone 2.**

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> A clearer description of audience: who are they, what are they interested in with respect to this site, and what are the design goals for that audience.

TODO

### Organization & Navigation (Milestone 2)
> A description of how you generated and considered alternatives for the site's content organization and navigation. You are required to include images here of your card sorting for determining the organization of content and the navigation.

> Thoroughly document this process. The _process_ is the important part of this assignment, not the final result.]

TODO

### Final Organization and Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Explain how the final organization of content and navigation is appropriate for your target audiences.

TODO


## Visual Design

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (2-4 sentences).

### Theme Ideas (Milestone 3)
> Discuss several ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Feel free to include some hand-drawn sketches (not digital drawings, not mock-ups, not wireframes, etc.) here to document your design process.

TODO

### Theme Design (Milestone 3)
> Discuss your theme designs: how did you come to them, what are their strengths and weaknesses, how do they fit your overall design goals and audiences?

> Emotion is a big part of design. What emotions where you thinking about or trying to convey in your designs?

TODO


## Rationale

**This rationale should be polished writing: one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.**

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs a few paragraphs (1-2). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during the design process and how you addressed them.

**All images must be visible in Markdown Preview for credit!**

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.

### Site Layout (Final Submission)
> Show your design process and final layout for your site. You must include photos of your sketches of the layout. No digital drawings permitted.

> You must label each figure and provide an explanation of the sketch.

![schedule page sketch version 1](example.png)
Example: (delete this) Sketch for Schedule page (version 1). Users can see a calendar of all bands planing in the main panel. I realized that the layout for the schedule may be confusing. I think separate sections for each day will work better for my audience's needs since they can focus on the bands they want to see for that day.
